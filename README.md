.Index.html:Containing the structure of the webpage.

.Style.css: I used it for styling the webpage, including layout and background image.

.Index.js: JavaScript code to manage fetching movie data, displaying details, and processing ticket bookings.

.db.json: Contains the movie details, including title, description, tickets sold, and showtimes.


# How the app works.
1.The Movie List section shows all available movies fetched from the films.json file.

2.Click on a movie to view detailed information, such as runtime, description, and available tickets.

3.If tickets are available, the "Buy Ticket" button is enabled. Clicking it decreases the number of available tickets and updates the display.

4.Once all tickets for a movie are sold, the "Sold Out" status appears and the buy ticket button is disabled.
